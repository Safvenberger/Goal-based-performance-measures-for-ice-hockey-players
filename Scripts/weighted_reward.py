    Extract the season, calculate occurrences, apply the reward function and 
    finally, calculate the weighted metrics and assign to the SQL database.

    Parameters
    ----------
    season : integer value of 4 characters (e.g. 2013)
        Selects games from the given season.
        Valid inputs are 2007 - 2014.
    suffix : string
        What to append at the end of the table name in the SQL database.
    start_date : integer value of format yyyymmdd
        The start date we are interested in examining.
    end_date : integer value of format yyyymmdd
        The end date we are interested in examining.
    create_copy : boolean
        If copies of the table, ending with suffix, should be added to the database. 
        The default is True.
    calc_occur : boolean
        Whether to create the mpbp table and calculate occurrences or simply
        apply the reward based on an already defined occurrences table.
    position_list : list
        A list of position(s) to calculate reward for.
        Default is an empty list (i.e. all positions).
    multiple_seasons : boolean
        Whether to start from the given season, specified in "season".
        The default is False.
    playoffs : boolean
        To consider only playoffs or regular season.
        The default is False.
    
    Returns
    -------
    None. The related changes are instead pushed to the SQL database.
